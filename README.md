Interactive data processing and analysis tool to compute the Curie point depth from aeromagnetic data

The user interface is really a work in progress for now.  More to come soon.

## Aeromagnetic Data



## Borehole Data

Borehole data should be in a csv file with the same header as given in the Global Heat Flow Datababse of the International Heat Flow Commission (http://www.heatflow.und.edu/index2.html).  An example file can be found at http://www.heatflow.und.edu/Global2010.csv
